	//Sample Database Connection Syntax for PHP and MySQL.
  
  //BELOW IS THE SIMPLE CODE YOU DATABSE CONNECTIVITY FOR YOUR WEBSITE TO YOUR DATABASE.
  IN THIS SCENARIO WE HAVA A WEBPAGE LIKE CONTACT US AND IT HASE FIELDS LIKE NAME,NUMBER,PHONE ETC THAT WE WANT WHEN YOUR SUBMIT THE CONTACT US FORM WE 
  SHOULD GET ALL THE DATA IN OUR DATABASE.


// below are some variable that when my submit button will be pressed the value in field email,name,subject will be send through post method.

$name=$_POST['reservation_name']; // here my name field name is "reservation_name".Your can be anything.
$email=$_POST['reservation_email'];
$subject=$_POST['person_select'];
$phone=$_POST['reservation_phone'];
$message=$_POST['form_message'];
  
  
	
	
$conn=mysql_connect('localhost','abcDB','abc123');
// Here the conn command will initate the sql connectivity to your database.The parameter inside the sql_connect('hostname of the server/ip','mysqlusername',
'password for the sql')

mysql_select_db('instatutor',$conn);
//Here you will declare your('dbname','and the conn variable where you have stored the hostname,username and password')
	

$sql="INSERT INTO contactus(name,email,subject,phone,message) VALUES ('$name','$email','$subject','$phone','$message')";
// when my submit button is called i want that values to get enter in my databse for that we need sql command.Here
we give simple sql command for inserting the value in my database. here my databse name is "contactus" again your can be anything.
// Look at the VALUES paramters. They are the variable that contain the user data that the user have entered in those fields.


$result = mysql_query($sql,$conn);
if (result)
{
	//echo "Success--" .$email ."--".$subject."--".$name."--".$phone."--".$message;
}

else{
	echo "Error";	
}
// The above optional code is simple if else code to make sure the database connectivity is working fine. You can also remove this code.

echo'<div class="alert alert-success" >
 
  <strong> We will get back to you soon!</strong>//This is after the form is  submitted a short success message for the user.
